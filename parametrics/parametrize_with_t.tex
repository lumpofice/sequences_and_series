\section{Parametrics in Variable t}

Until this point, $y$ has been dependent $x$, while $x$ has been an independent variable enjoying some predefined domain. In this section, we take a look at some curves in the $xy$-plane that are formed from variables $x$ and $y$ as functions of independent variable $t$.
